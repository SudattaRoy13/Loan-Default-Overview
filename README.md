# ðŸ“Š Loan Default Overview â€“ Power BI Project
I analyzed a Loan Default Dataset using Power BI to identify factors influencing repayment. The project visualized borrower details like income, credit score, DTI, and loan purpose. Insights showed patterns in defaults, helping banks refine lending policies and make data-driven loan approval decisions.

Built in **Power BI** with **15 KPIs across 3 pages**, the report helps **bank officials identify risks and make informed lending decisions**.
